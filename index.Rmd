## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to... American poverty or perhaps ideology
in the United states... who knows... but on a serious note; there is so many things I could
think about researching. I am interested in the way the economy has grown over the years
and how that has affected American lives all over America. I want to learn more about 
how money has influenced Americans and perhaps their political lives. Hopefully
I can find data relating both economics and politics which would be quite interesting.
